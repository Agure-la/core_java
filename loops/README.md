         Loops and Control Statements in Java
This README file provides an overview of the loop and control statements concepts in Java.

Loops
Loops are used in programming to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. There are three types of loops in Java:

1. For loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. 


            for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // Code to be executed
             }
2. While loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, but the loop should continue until a certain condition is met. 


           while (condition) {
              // Code to be executed
              }
3. Do-while loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the code inside the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

          do {
             // Code to be executed
             } while (condition);

             Control Statements

Control statements are used to change the order of execution of the program. There are two types of control statements in Java:

1. If statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. 

         if (condition) {
          // Code to be executed
         }
2. Switch case statement
The switch statement is used when there are multiple conditions to be checked. The switch statement evaluates an expression and compares it with multiple cases until it finds a match. The syntax for the switch statement is:
