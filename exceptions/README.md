Generate Arithmetic Exception Without Exception Handling:
This program will generate an arithmetic exception due to the division of an integer by zero, without any exception handling. This can result in a runtime error.

Handle the Arithmetic Exception Using Try-Catch Block:
This program demonstrates how to handle the arithmetic exception using the try-catch block. The catch block will catch the exception and handle it gracefully.

Write a Method Which Throws Exception, Call That Method in Main Class Without Try Block:
This program defines a method that throws an exception and calls the method in the main class without a try block. This will cause the exception to be thrown to the calling method, and the calling method can handle the exception.

Program With Multiple Catch Blocks:
This program demonstrates how to handle multiple exceptions using multiple catch blocks. The try block will execute code that may throw multiple exceptions, and the catch blocks will catch each exception and handle it appropriately.

Program to Throw Exception With Your Own Message:
This program shows how to throw an exception with a custom message. The custom message will provide more information about the exception and make it easier to debug.

Program to Create Your Own Exception:
This program demonstrates how to create a custom exception by extending the Exception class. This custom exception can be used to handle specific scenarios where standard exceptions are not sufficient.

Program With Finally Block:
This program shows how to use the finally block to execute code that will always run, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

Generate Arithmetic Exception:
This program will generate an arithmetic exception by dividing an integer by zero.

Generate ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
This program will generate an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException by trying to access an array element that is out of bounds.

Generate ClassNotFoundException:
This program will generate a ClassNotFoundException by trying to load a class that does not exist.

Generate FileNotFoundException:
This program will generate a FileNotFoundException by trying to access a file that does not exist.

Generate IOException:
This program will generate an IOException by trying to read or write a file that is not accessible.

Generate NoSuchFieldException:
This program will generate a NoSuchFieldException by trying to access a field that does not exist.

Generate NoSuchMethodException:
This program will generate a NoSuchMethodException by trying to access a method that does not exist.

Generate NullPointerException:
This program will generate a NullPointerException by trying to access a null object.

Generate NumberFormatException:
This program will generate a NumberFormatException by trying to convert a string to a numeric type when the string is not a valid number.
