      Functions for Array Operations
In this readme file, we will discuss various functions for array operations in programming.

add - This function adds all the elements of an array and returns the sum.
average - This function calculates the average of all the elements in an array and returns the result.
findIndex - This function takes a number as input and returns the index of that number in an array.
findValue - This function takes a specific value as input and returns whether that value is present in the array or not.
copyArray - This function copies the content of one array to another.
removeElement - This function takes a specific element as input and removes it from the array.
getMax - This function returns the maximum value present in the array.
getMin - This function returns the minimum value present in the array.
reverseArray - This function prints the array in reverse order.
duplicateValue - This function takes a specific value as input and checks whether it is present in the array or not.
commonInArray - This function takes two arrays as input and returns the common integers present in both arrays.
removeDuplicates - This function removes duplicate elements from an array.
getSecondLargest - This function returns the second largest number present in an array.
numberOfEvenOdd - This function takes an array as input and checks how many times an odd and even number appears in the array.
differenceMinMax - This function calculates the difference between the maximum number and minimum number present in the array.
findTwoNumbersArray - This function takes two specific numbers as input and checks whether both numbers are present in the array or not.
