The super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class of a subclass. It is used to call the parent class constructor, access parent class methods, or access parent class variables.

For example, if we have a class named Child which extends another class named Parent, we can use the super keyword in the Child class to access the constructor, methods, or variables of the Parent class.

This keyword is useful in cases where we want to reuse the code of the parent class in the child class or override the behavior of the parent class methods.

    THIS Keyword in Java:
The this keyword in Java is used to refer to the current object of a class. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and local variables in a method or constructor.

For example, if we have a class named Person with instance variables name and age, and a method named display which has a local variable with the same name as the instance variable name, we can use the this keyword to refer to the instance variable.
