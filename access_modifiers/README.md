Class Accessibility in Java
In Java, there are four access modifiers to control the accessibility of fields and methods in a class: private, default (no access modifier), protected, and public.

Private Class
In a private class, all the fields and methods are only accessible within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from any other class, including subclasses.

In this example, we create a private class with private fields and methods. We call the private methods in the main method of the class itself.

Default Class
In a default class (no access modifier), all the fields and methods are accessible within the same package. They cannot be accessed from any other package.

In this example, we create a default class with default fields and methods.

Protected Class
In a protected class, all the fields and methods are accessible within the same package and from any subclass (even if the subclass is in a different package).

In this example, we create a protected class with protected fields and methods. We access the fields and methods from another class in the same package.

Public Class
In a public class, all the fields and methods are accessible from any class in any package.
