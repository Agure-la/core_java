 ArrayList Operations
An ArrayList is a dynamic array in Java that allows adding or removing elements at runtime. In this guide, we will perform some common operations on ArrayList.
   HashMap Operations
HashMap is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. In this guide, we will perform some common operations on HashMap.

        TASKS
  

 Create an ArrayList of type String with 10 string elements. Add 10 string elements to ArrayList and perform the below operations
Add an element to the ArrayList
Iterate through the ArrayList by using Iterator object
Add an element at a specific index
Remove an element from the ArrayList, Remove at an index Update the element at a specific index
Check the element is present at a particular index
Get an element at a particular index
Find out the size of the ArrayList
Check the given element is present in the ArrayList
Remove all elements of the ArrayList
2. Create a HashMap with at least 10 key value pairs of the Student ID and Name Insert a Key value mapping into the map
Fetch the value of a Key
Create a clone/copy of HashMap
Check if the given Key is in the Map
Check if the value is in the Map
Check if the map is empty
Print the size of the Map to the console Print all the Keys of the map to the console Print all the Keys of the map to the console Remove a specific Key-value pair
Copy all the elements of the Map to another Map
3. Create a HashSet with at least 10 elements of type String Write program covering all the operations of HashSet


Sets do not accept duplicate values(they conatin unique values)
