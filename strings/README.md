      String Operations in Java
Strings are used extensively in Java programming, and many operations can be performed on them. Here are some of the most common operations on strings:

Different ways creating a string: Strings can be created in Java using string literals, character arrays, or using the new keyword to create a new instance of a string.

Concatenating two strings using + operator: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator, which joins two strings together.

Finding the length of the string: The length of a string can be determined using the length() method.

Extract a string using Substring: Substrings can be extracted from a string using the substring() method, which takes a start index and an optional end index as parameters.

Searching in strings using indexOf(): The indexOf() method can be used to search for a specific substring within a larger string.

Matching a String Against a Regular Expression With matches(): The matches() method can be used to check if a string matches a regular expression.

Comparing strings using the methods equals(), equalsIgnoreCase(), startsWith(), endsWith() and compareTo(): Strings can be compared to each other using a variety of methods, including equals(), equalsIgnoreCase(), startsWith(), endsWith(), and compareTo().

Trimming strings with trim(): The trim() method can be used to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.

Replacing characters in strings with replace(): The replace() method can be used to replace characters within a string.

Splitting strings with split(): The split() method can be used to split a string into an array of substrings.

Converting Numbers to Strings with valueOf(): The valueOf() method can be used to convert numbers to strings.

Converting integer objects to Strings: The toString() method can be used to convert integer objects to strings.

Converting to uppercase and lowercase: The toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() methods can be used to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.
