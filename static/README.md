      HOW TO WORK WITH STATIC VARIABLE AND STATIC METHODS


Declare and initialize instance variable:
An instance variable is declared inside a class and outside of any method. It is not a static variable, which means each instance of the class has its own copy of the instance variable. To declare an instance variable, you just need to use the data type followed by the variable name.

Declare and initialize static variable:
A static variable is declared inside a class but outside of any method, and it belongs to the class, not to any instance of the class. To declare a static variable, use the static keyword followed by the data type and variable name.

Create instance methods:
Instance methods are non-static methods that belong to an instance of the class. They can access instance variables and static variables.

Create static methods:
Static methods are methods that belong to the class and not to any instance of the class. They cannot access instance variables directly but can access static variables.

Print instance variable inside static method:
To access an instance variable inside a static method, you need to create an instance of the class and use that instance to access the variable.

Print static variable inside instance method:
To access a static variable inside an instance method, you can use the class name followed by the variable name.

Call static method inside instance method:
To call a static method inside an instance method, you can use the class name followed by the method name.

Call instance method inside static method:
To call an instance method inside a static method, you need to create an instance of the class and call the method using that instance.
