The files in this directory show how to us different operators in java

   1. Arithmetic operators (*, -, +, /) used to perform mathematical operations
   2. Decrement and increment operators (++, --) used to increment varible values by one nad decrement variable values by 1.
   3. Logical operaotors (||, &&, !=) || is used to check if one condition is true, && checks if both conditions are true, != check for not equal


Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Increment/Decrement Operators
Increment/decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. There are two types of increment/decrement operators: pre-increment (++) and post-increment (++).

Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). 



            TASKS

1.  Write a function for arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/)
2. Write a method for increment and decrement operators(++, --)
3. Program to equal operator and not equal operators
4. Write a program to find the two numbers equal or not.
5. Programs on Logical AND,OR operator and Logical NOT
6. Program for relational operators (<,<==, >, >==)
7. Print the smaller and larger number
