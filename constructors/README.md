In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize the objects of a class. It has the same name as the class and no return type. Constructors are invoked when an object of the class is created using the new keyword.

Constructor Overloading
In Java, we can create multiple constructors in a class with different parameters. This is known as constructor overloading.

Super Class Constructors
In Java, when we create a child class that extends a parent class, the child class inherits all the members of the parent class including its constructors. We can call the constructors of the parent class using the super() method.

Access Modifiers
In Java, constructors can have different access modifiers, such as private, public, protected, and default.

Return Type
Constructors do not have a return type. They cannot return any value.

Calling Constructors
We can call constructors using the new keyword. When we call the constructor of a class multiple times with the same object, it will create a new object each time.

Here are some programs related to constructors in Java:

Create a class with a default constructor, one argument constructor and two argument constructors. Instantiate the class to call all the constructors of that class from a main class.

Call the constructors(both default and argument constructors) of super class from a child class.

Apply private, public, protected and default access modifiers to the constructor.

Write constructors with return type int and String.

Try to call the constructor multiple times with the same object.
